## Hi there 👋
# Hi, I'm Carson

Data science student with a focus on sports analytics, machine learning, and interactive visualization. I build projects that answer real questions with data—not just demonstrate techniques.

## Featured Projects

### [NFL QB Decision-Making Analysis](https://github.com/carsonmo1/Big_Data_Bowl_2026) — Big Data Bowl 2026
Machine learning pipeline combining route classification (77% accuracy) and catch probability prediction (82% accuracy) to evaluate quarterback target selection. Analysis reveals QBs only target the optimal receiver ~25% of the time. Includes interactive coaching tool built with Dash.

`Python` `scikit-learn` `XGBoost` `Dash` `Plotly`

### [NBA 3-Point Revolution Dashboard](link)
Interactive application tracking the evolution of 3-point shooting from 1996-2025. Features custom efficiency metrics (PEC), cross-filtering across multiple visualizations, and data sourced from NBA.com API and Basketball Reference.

`Python` `Dash` `Plotly` `REST APIs` `Web Scraping`

---

### [NCAA Transfer Portal Analysis](link)
End-to-end pipeline from web scraping to Tableau dashboard, built to identify transfer targets for a college basketball program. Includes feature engineering for player evaluation and actionable recommendations delivered to coaching staff.

`Python` `Tableau` `Web Scraping` `ETL`

---

### [Health Risk Prediction Model](link)
Classification models on BRFSS survey data predicting health outcomes. Emphasis on handling severe class imbalance and optimizing recall for medical screening applications where false negatives carry higher cost.

`Python` `XGBoost` `CatBoost` `imbalanced-learn`

---

### [NFL Player Safety & Rule Changes](link) *(in progress)*
SQL-driven analysis testing whether safety-focused rule changes (roughing the passer, targeting) actually reduced player injuries or created unintended behavioral incentives. Combines penalty data, injury reports, and statistical inference.

`SQL` `Python` `Statistical Inference` `nflverse`

---

### [NLP: Product Review Analysis](link)
Text analysis of exercise equipment reviews extracting sentiment patterns and themes from unstructured customer feedback.

`Python` `NLP` `Text Mining`
